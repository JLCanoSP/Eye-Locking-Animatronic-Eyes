# Eye-Locking-Animatronic-Eyes
California State Polytechnic University, Pomona
Julien Luis Cano - Senior Project

This is my senior capstone project for Cal Poly Pomona 
My inspiration came from the "Realistic and Interactive Robot Gaze" https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9341297

Goal: Animatronic Eyes that use Landmark Detection using OpenCV, Raspbery Pi, and Python in order to maintain eye contact of animatronic eyes
